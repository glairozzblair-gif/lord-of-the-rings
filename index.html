                <div class="note">
                    The Lord of the Rings explores the battle between good and evil by following the journey of ordinary individuals who rise to extraordinary courage. At its core, the story shows that true heroism does not come from strength or status but from perseverance,
                    friendship, and moral integrity. The One Ring symbolizes the corrupting nature of power, tempting even the noblest characters and revealing how difficult it is to resist domination and desire. Through the Fellowship’s struggles, Tolkien
                    emphasizes the importance of unity, hope, and sacrifice in overcoming darkness. Ultimately, the book teaches that even the smallest person can change the world and that victory often requires both bravery and humility.
